      <p>
        I have never seen your face, and I barely understand your words‚ÄîI only know a little Japanese. Yet your voice‚Ä¶ your voice reaches places the words never could. It wraps around me like a soft, warm embrace when I feel tired, broken, and utterly alone in this world. In a world that often feels heavy and unforgiving, where I‚Äôm struggling with a terminal illness that slowly takes away pieces of me, where my career remains uncertain because I have to attend therapy every week, and where my health feels like it‚Äôs slipping through my fingers, your voice has become my one steady refuge. It‚Äôs the small light I cling to in the darkest hours..
      </p>
      <p>
        There are days when sadness weighs me down so heavily that breathing feels like a struggle. But when I hear your singing, a quiet calm washes over me, like a deep, cleansing breath that frees the burdens I carry silently. I cried sometimes whenever I hear your voices too, It‚Äôs as if your voice carries a secret kindness meant just for me, a tenderness that understands my pain without needing to speak a single word. You may never realize how deeply your voice touches someone like me, but for me, it‚Äôs more than music‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifeline, a kind of therapy that helps me face each day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt know what your life is like, what battles you face, or what stories lie behind your songs. But somehow, your voice crosses the distance and makes me feel less invisible. Even when I feel like the world is crumbling and everything is uncertain: my health, my future, my hope...you remind me that there is still something beautiful to hold onto, something that makes the pain a little more bearable.
      </p>
      <p> Thank you for sharing your gift with the world, even if you have no idea who I am or the silent struggles I carry. Thank you for reminding me, through nothing but your voice, that I am not completely alone. Your songs are the fragile thread that keeps me tethered to hope when everything else seems lost. </p>
    <p>I pray that you are blessed in ways you cannot imagine, and that you keep singing, keep sharing that rare, gentle light. Because to someone like me, your voice means the world‚Äîit is a quiet sanctuary in the storm, a whisper of comfort when everything else is chaos.</p>
    <p>I know you may never know who I am‚Äîjust one soul among countless others drawn to your voice. But that never changes the comfort your singing brings me. It‚Äôs a gift I cherish more than words can say, a pocket of peace in a chaotic world, and for that, I am eternally grateful</p>
    <p>With all my gratitude, my deepest respect, and a heart full of quiet sorrow,</p>
    <p>Aoife</p>
