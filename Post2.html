        Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I’m just a person trying to figure things out — someone who thinks too much i guess, feels too deeply, and probably plays too much game when stressed. I grew up keeping a lot to myself, but lately I’ve been trying to express who I really am — even if it’s just through texting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I dream of working in a cozy cubicle with a city view, decorating my desk with little figures and maybe a Blahaj, alot of blahaj. I love games, music, and soft little things that make the world feel kinder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life’s been kinda messy — weird jobs, unfair pay, health stuff, and a lot of late-night thinking. But I’m still here. And maybe this site is my way of saying: “Hey, I exist. I’m trying. And I want to make something for myself, even if it’s small.” Thanks for stopping by. Hope you’re doing okay too.

      <p> to be honest i dont really know what i should write, i like cute stuff, i dont know why, since child i like cute and feminine stuff but people keep telling me i am wrong and i supposed to like something masculine, i thought it was true at first, i thought i was weird
      </p>
      <p> i thought it was just a phase, i mean phase of me liking girly stuff, i kinda imagine in the future i might be cured or something<p>
        <p> But.. not really, </p>
      <p> I am already 24 years old today, and you know what ? i still like those thing eventhough it feels so wrong, but i wont lie to my feeling, i like it and i dont want other people tell me what to like </p>
      <p> Now i am in the end of 24 years old and i got a disease that seems it cannot get cured, it harsh innit, but i swear i dont cry, i just said "it is what it is"
