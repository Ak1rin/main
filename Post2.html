      <p>
        Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I‚Äôm just a person trying to figure things out ‚Äî someone who thinks too much i guess, feels too deeply, and probably plays too much game when stressed. I grew up keeping a lot to myself, but lately I‚Äôve been trying to express who I really am ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs just through texting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I dream of working in a cozy cubicle with a city view, decorating my desk with little figures and maybe a Blahaj, alot of blahaj. I love games, music, and soft little things that make the world feel kinder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life‚Äôs been kinda messy ‚Äî weird jobs, unfair pay, health stuff, and a lot of late-night thinking. But I‚Äôm still here. And maybe this site is my way of saying: ‚ÄúHey, I exist. I‚Äôm trying. And I want to make something for myself, even if it‚Äôs small.‚Äù Thanks for stopping by. Hope you‚Äôre doing okay too. 
      <p>i was born in very strict religious family, it harsh, i dont have any privacy since i was a child, no doors in the bedroom even until now, what i hatee the most about when i grow up is my parent often beat me up senseless, you know what their reason is ? they said they only follow order from god</p>
      <p>ive been told many times when i was a kid if a kid aged 8 did wrong parent can beat me up in the name of god, silly innit ? yes it what i feel everyday, bruished skin is my daily food, i ask forgiveness to stop, i beg god to stop but no answer, no one ever helped me</p>
      <p>and the school era of me is also bad too you know, got bullied a lot, people never call me my name, they always made up my name, mock me, and whenever there is a group prohject i always left alone, no one really want to be with me you know, and when someone forced to group with me they just mock me relentlessly</p>
      <p>6 years in middle and high school is full of hell, i dont really have friend, get left behind, got bullied physically and mentally, no one ever help, i back asking god and no asnwer from Him too</p>
      <p>Everyday in school i always in fight and flight response, i sweat a lot, my heartbeat always beat fast, i wanna puke whenever i going to class, i wanna bang my head to a wall or something, it hurts, i cannot take it anymore</p>
      <p>No one really ever kind to me, everyone who close with me always ask me something and if i am not useful they will talk bad behind me</p>
      <p>Its hard to live like this...</p>
      <p>Weirdly enough suddenly in the high school i got 1 friend, he always sit beside me, i tried my best to show how bad i am and how uninstered i am but he still near me</p>
      <P>And whener he didnt attend school my heart was about to break and i sweat provously, i dunno without him i think i never survive highschool, but unfortunately until now i never said thanks to him, i dont know how to said it, i really wanna ask him why he befriend with some useless human like me</P>
      <p>In the college nothing major is happening in my life, its getting better, i met best PHD teacher, he was graduated from buffalo US or something he is so kind, he is somekind of pastor, i dont really get how he is so kind, he unlike other teacher i met, he even asking me how is it going now and something like that</p>
  
    </p>
      <p> to be honest i dont really know what i should write anymore, i like cute stuff, i dont know why, since child i like cute and feminine stuff but people keep telling me i am wrong and i supposed to like something masculine, i thought it was true at first, i thought i was weird
      </p>
      <p> i thought it was just a phase, i mean phase of me liking girly stuff, i kinda imagine in the future i might be cured or something<p>
        <p> But.. not really, </p>
      <p> I am already 24 years old today, and you know what ? i still like those thing eventhough it feels so wrong, but i wont lie to my feeling, i like it and i dont want other people tell me what to like </p>
      <p> Now i am in the end of 24 years old and i got a disease that seems it cannot get cured, it harsh innit, but i swear i dont cry, i just said "it is what it is" and going on with it, its cancer right, everyweek need to go on hospital and evreything, its hard, i dont feels sane anymore" </p>
        <p> every week i got an injection, and the tip is so big, it makes me bleed, i know my life may not long, but i try my best to spend my last day to be what i am, what i wish to be" </p>
